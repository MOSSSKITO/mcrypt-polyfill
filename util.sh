Usage:
./util.sh [command]

Provides functionality for working with the mcrypt-polyfill codebase, mainly
focused on running tests.

Commands:

local-test:
  Just run the tests on your current environment. No attempt will be made to
  enable/disable mcrypt or change the PHP version.

run-test:
  Runs a single test for mcrypt-polyfill. Depends on values for \$PHP_VERSION and
  \$ENABLE_MCRYPT having values to set up the environment.

  Allowed values for \$PHP_VERSION: 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0
  Allowed values for \$ENABLE_MCRYPT: 0, 1

run-all-tests:
  Runs tests for all permutations of \$PHP_VERSION and \$ENABLE_MCRYPT. Note that
  this is a local utility. It is not used for CI tests for mcrypt-polyfill.

upload-coverage:
  Uploads code coverage information to Coveralls if we're on a Coveralls-enabled
  environment.
